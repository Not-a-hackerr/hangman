# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.


## Project Description
- This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The user has multiple lives to attempt to guess the hidden word. 
- The user will guess one letter at a time and if the letter is correct it will reveal the rightly guessed letter. Although an incorrect guess leads to a life being taken.
- If the user guessing correctly guesses the word before they run out of attempts they are the winner, although if the user cannot guess the word in the set number of attempts, the inital user who entered the word is the winner
