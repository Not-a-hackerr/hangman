# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.


## Project Description
- This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. The user has multiple lives to attempt to guess the hidden word. 
- The user will guess one letter at a time and if the letter is correct it will reveal the rightly guessed letter. Although an incorrect guess leads to a life being taken.
